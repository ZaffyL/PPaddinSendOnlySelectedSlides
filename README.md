# PPaddinSendOnlySelectedSlides
PowerPoint Addin Send Only Selected Slides toolbar

I originally created this PowerPoint add-in in 2014, however till today still get requests for it. I just wanted to distribute it in case it might make your life a bit easier.

## Introduction:
Some of us have that situation, where people ask us for particular PowerPoint slides. Which often results in us copying and pasting, or saving a new version to the desktop and deleting the slides we don’t need, at times this can be a 10-20 minute issue (depending on the size of the deck).

## What this toolbar does?
Is create 3 buttons, which do the following:
1.The first button saves a copy of the PowerPoint presentation to your desktop only with the Selected Slides.
2.The second button saves a copy of the PowerPoint presentation only with the Selected Slides to your desktop, and attaches    ...it to a new email.
3.The 3rd Button is a help button in case you forget what the buttons do.
 
## Disclaimer:
I know some of the consulting firms buy software packages to add this functionality to PowerPoint, I just thought it would be cool and save some of our time if we had this feature.

The PowerPoint add-in attached to this email provides the functionality explained above, however please be aware that this has only been tested on Office 2010/ Office 2013 and Windows 7, however I do not foresee it having problems if used on Office 2007 and Windows 7 – (Anything older and you on your own).

Also whilst this add-in does not delete any presentation content (merely copies), I will not hold myself accountable for any loss or issues you may perceive happened as a result of it. 
 
## What is included in the attachments:
 
Attached is a zip file with 3 items and includes a word document with installation instructions.
 
### The zip file:
*Includes a certificate, this you will have to install first, as it proves to your computer that the code was developed by ...myself and asks your computer to trust it.
*Includes the add-in file which will need to be copied to the C:\Users\<Windows username>\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Addins\ ...folder
*Installation instructions in word document format.
